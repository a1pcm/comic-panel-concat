##Comic Panel Concatenator

Tool to join comic panels together, for large projects.

To use, create a root directory for your project.

Then, create folders in that root directory that have the format ### (single integer) or ###-### (a range, with the first integer strictly smaller than the second).

In those folders, you may store your panels. They must all be of the same width. They must also be sorted in the order you want them to appear in (this program uses alphabetical sort).

Then just input your information into the GUI and press "Go". (Debug Mode labels your panels in the finished product with red numbering, so you can see if your panels are truly in order)

The program has no progress bar, so you must wait until the program says it is complete.
